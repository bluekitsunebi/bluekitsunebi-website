      "Mobile apps? Websites? Or maybe you want to learn how server-side programming works? Whatever the reason, we are more than ready to help you. Programming is often seen as a field accessible only to the exceptionally gifted, but in reality, anyone with an average level of intelligence has every chance to become a programmer if they put in the necessary effort. Most tasks of a software developer involve reusing and merging existing pieces of code or following a predefined structure, which can be learned with enough practice.",

      "Our lessons are designed by programmers with real-world experience and knowledge in a wide variety of programming languages and technologies currently used by most companies worldwide. The programming languages taught in our courses depend on each individual's goal and include the following technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React. The reason we chose JavaScript as the language to teach is its versatility. It is used both for the server side and database communication as well as for the user interface side, with which the user interacts. Knowing JavaScript opens the most doors for you to get your first job in the IT field. Python on the other side is easy to use and perfect for fast development and scripting, being mainly used for building APIs, data processing and AI.",

      "A large part of a software developer's time is occupied by fixing various errors that occur during the development process. As you gain experience, identifying the part of the code that causes the error becomes instinctive, but at the beginning, it's easy to get lost not knowing how to proceed. We are here to give you a helping hand in the fight against any errors you encounter throughout the learning process, so don't worry!"
