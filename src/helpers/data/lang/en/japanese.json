        "If you want to become a professional, understand anime without subtitles, plan to visit Japan, or simply want to learn Japanese as a hobby, you've come to the right place. We pride ourselves on the quality of our lessons and the progress our students make, and our Japanese teacher's knowledge far surpasses many other options on the market. The idea is simple: You like it and dedicate the necessary time ➔ you'll progress in a way you probably can't even imagine."

        "Japanese is accessible to everyone, having many logical elements and being easy to assimilate when taught correctly. Basic grammar is simplistic, pronunciation is not that hard, and the vocabulary and the three alphabets can be mastered with enough dedication. Considering that you already know English, which is known for its irregularities in both spelling and pronunciation, you'll find Japanese easier to digest as it strictly adheres to its rules. A good teacher can answer any question, no matter its difficulty. With us, things are even better - you can ask anything even outside class hours. You heard something in an anime or read a difficult passage somewhere? Go ahead and ask! ",
